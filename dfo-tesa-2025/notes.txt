# Topics to make sure we hit based on feedback:

Use with fisheries dependent data. Can we? With what caveats?
Use of environmental covariates
Use with tracking datasets?
Wrapping head around why we need the mesh + SPDE
Model diagnostics and validation
Integrating data types
Common problems when starting out
Is there likely a need for High Performance Computing with sdmTMB for fitting and/or simulation?

# New stuff to get in somewhere in existing slides:
- AICc
- Generalized gamma
- Poisson-link models?

- prediction grids?

- types of residuals

# New slides:

- Data integration
  - What it means
  - Things to worry about
  - Basic catchability stuff

- Multivariate
  - What you can do with sdmTMB
  - When to move to tinyVAST
